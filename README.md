# TrafficLights
#Author: Megan West #Title: Aneo Sponsored Puzzle: Traffic Lights #Goal of this puzzle: You enter a section of road and you plan to rely entirely #on your cruise control to cross through the area without having to stop or #slow down. The goal is to find the maximum speed (without speeding) that will #allow you to cross all the traffic lights while they are green. #Warning: You can't cross a traffic light the second it turns red! #Your vehicle enters the zone directly at the speed programmed on the cruise #control which ensures that it does not change.
