Title: Aneo Sponsored Puzzle: Traffic Lights 
Goal of this puzzle: You drive through a section of road that contains several traffic lights and you plan to rely entirely on your cruise control to cross through the area without having to stop or slow down. This algorithm finds the maximum speed (without speeding) that will allow you to cross through all of the traffic lights while they are green. Warning: You can't cross a traffic light the second it turns red! 
Your vehicle enters the zone directly at the speed programmed on the cruise #control which ensures that it does not change.
